This is a compilation of frequently asked questions. If you have any question not listed here and you think it should be listed here, feel free to make a PR or ask in the roblox-ts discord.

## When do I use [`OnInit`](./lifecycle-events#oninit) over [`OnStart`](./lifecycle-events#onstart)?
Flamework has two lifecycle events called during ignition: `OnInit` and `OnStart`. These events are similar but they serve two very distinct purposes.

`OnInit` is called sequentially for every singleton in the order you define through `loadOrder`. If any singleton fails to `OnInit` then Flamework will abort ignition instead of trying to recover. It is not safe to use other dependencies in this event as they may not yet be initialized. Yielding in `OnInit` will also delay ignition.

`OnStart` is called on a new thread for every singleton and, like `OnInit`, it runs in the order defined by `loadOrder`. However, yielding will not delay ignition and errors will not cause ignition to be aborted.

`OnInit` is intended exclusively for code that needs to delay, or abort, ignition or run before other dependencies attempt to use your singleton and should be used as sparingly as possible.

`OnStart` is intended for everything else.

## Flamework cannot be built in a dirty environment.
This error occurs whenever you attempt to compile Flamework with incremental mode enabled in a project that was not previously using Flamework. You should delete your `out` directory which will cause TypeScript to completely recompile your project.

## Element implicitly has an 'any' type because expression of type '"<RANDOM\>"' can't be used to index type 'ServerHandler/ClientHandler'.
This error occurs due to a roblox-ts bug with incremental mode. You should disable Flamework's obfuscation when using watch mode and only enable it for full builds.
